# Parallel-computation-on-hyper-quicksort

The Hyper quicksort by Bruce Wager was studied.

Improved the efficiency of sequential quicksort algorithm by replacing it with the parallel modified hyper quicksort algorithm.

The input was run parallely with different processors using the hyper quicksort algorithm.

Compared the performances of quicksort and hyper quicksort with different processors. (64 - 1M processors)

Concluded the high performance of hyper quicksort for large number of processors with visualizations. </small></li>
